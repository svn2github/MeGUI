0.2.3.2193: *Development version*
Commit by berrinam
	- Merged the refactor with 2192. Still a few bugs around the place. Consult readme.txt for details of the refactor.

0.2.3.2192
Commit by Doom9
	- Subtitle processing via VobSub

0.2.3.2191
Commit by Doom9
	- Fixed adaptive muxer when loading a raw video stream (MediaInfo can't handle those, leading to mux scenarios that cause a crash)
	- Fixed delay and settings being overwritten when audio streams were being changed
	- Added audio delays for mux-only sources
	- Added audio delays to one click mode (taken from the filename), applied to both mux-only and encodable audio sources
	- Added language codes for divxmux (not all languages may be supported, divxmux is even more limited than mp4box)
	- Added cancel button (ESC) to all dialogs that have a cancel / abort button
	- Swapped out a few remaining Cancel and OK/Queue buttons
	- Existing mux job with a muxed video input can now be updated
	- Added DRC for AC3/DTS sources when "increase volume" is checked

0.2.3.2190
Commit by Doom9
	- Added a mod4 horizontal crop mode to the anamorphic cropping modes (to be used instead of non mod16 as this can cause non mod4 horizontal resolutions which cannot be encoded)
	- Added VobSub subtitles as supported subtitle type to the mkv muxer - this will prevent weird mux paths containing an avi job to include the subs
	- Added chapter handling to the automatic mux path finding so that chapters will be taken into account in autoencode and the adaptive muxer
	- Added support for audio track names in the mkv muxer
	- Enabled vobsub muxing in the mp4 muxer
	- Added autoencode defaults in the settings (keep in mind that the container selection will work only if you select compatible input types, avc video, mp4 audio and avi output just don't go together ;)

0.2.3.2189
Commit by Doom9
	- Audio overhead for AVI files is properly calculated
	- DTS/MP2 audio no longer throws the bitrate calculator out of whack
	- Creating a new profile no longer overwrites the currently active one
	- New way of doing profiles... updating a profile now requires selecting the profile, make changes, press update
		As a result, config windows no longer serve as profile selectors, you always have to select the desired profile where profiles are being used
	- Swapped the position of OK and Cancel button to correspond to the Windows standard
	- Autocrop no longer crashes when the preview is being closed and reopened before cropping

0.2.3.2188

  - dgindex reports video % instead of film % when video % > 50 starting with v1.4.8, adapted megui to not apply forcefilm in such a case
  - reshuffled menu shortcuts, megui no longer uses standard shortcuts like CTRL-A/C/V/X
  - Changelog now has its own dialog
  - Introduced a help menu with links to the megui wiki and the support forum

Apply Richard Berg's Progress Status menu item patch (makes it checkable, like VDub)

0.2.3.2014 13 Jan 2006
Add Autmatic interlace detection in Avisynth window and OneClick

0.2.3.2013 12 Jan 2006
Updated Setenv.bat for .NET 2.0
Fixed all warnings in SettingsForm.cs for x264 conditional compilation

0.2.3.2012 12 Jan 2006
Completely rewrite the video encoder part. Should be less error prone, return more commandline feedback and it supports xvid_encraw
xvid_encraw support: For now, only raw and mp4 output will work properly because encraw can only output raw. Automated bitrate calculation will be
off because mencoder takes container overhead into account for xvid.. encraw won't (and it uses bit/s for the bitrate but that's handled)
Please test encraw in manual mode and report how it works
Removed various .Net 1.1 workarounds that are no longer needed and code that would cause warnings in .NET 1.1
Commandline generation has been changed for the video part to not include the binary name.. this allows the latest executable path to be used for encoding

0.2.3.2011 11 Jan 2006
Enlarged the MeGUI-x264 video profile combobox in the main Form.

0.2.3.2010 11 Jan 2006
Reverted Level -> MB changes.

Fixed the AutoEncode crash caused by AudioStream.name being null

0.2.3.2008 10 Jan 2006
Update Minimize to Tray to work with conditional compiling
update compile.bat to work with .NET 2.0.50727. This only works if you have that exact version, so, hopefully, someone can find a better way to do this.

0.2.3.2007 10 Jan 2006
Add Minimize To Tray menu item
Fix the Load DLL bug
Fix the IVTC checkbox bug

0.2.3.2006 10 Jan 2006
Fix a crash in OneClick mode caused by audio stream's name not being set.
Fix a crash in OneClick mode when it detects too many files as DGIndex's output (made it's detection of these files more selective)

0.2.3.2003 10 Jan 2006
Restored x264 tri-state the way it was before the whole tri-state was rewritten to a single method (that implies grayed out controls means also they're disabled in the commandline)

0.2.3.2002 8 Jan 2006
Some small design fixes in x264 configuration dialog

0.2.3.2001 8 Jan 2006
Fixed BiME and Chroma ME options not showing in command line preview

0.2.3.2 8 Jan 2006
Added missing --bime turbo exclusion for conditional compilation
Fixed logic for "Turbo" in x264DialogTriStateAdjustment()

0.2.3.1040 7 Jan 2006
In x264 config, setting the turbo option in a first pass mode does no longer changes GUI options.

0.2.3.1039 7 Jan 2006
Fixed :name tag support so spaces won't cause problems (patch by godhead)

0.2.3.1038 7 Jan 2006
Added support for the :name tag in mp4box (patch by godhead)

0.2.3.1037 7 Jan 2006
Removed the ability to save profiles with empty names. Added additional checks to ensure that these rogue profiles aren't loaded or saved.
 
0.2.3.1036 (work in progress)
Completed the code to enable/disable controls and labels in both tri-state and encoding mode
Modified the x264 Config Dialog desing a bit
*Made x264DialogTriStateAdjustment() to restore some of the default settings when switching profiles or enabling options that enables a group. (Removed coz it was crashing MeGUI without apparent reason!)
Changed "Codec" in "Encoder" in x264, snow, xvid and lavc dialogs titles
Fixed some conditional compilation warnings

0.2.3.1035 6 Jan 2006

0.2.3.1033 6 Jan 2006
Small fix to ensure all the shutdown checkboxes reflect the current state correctly.

0.2.3.1032a 6 Jan 2006
Fixed x264 conditional compiling.

0.2.3.1032 6 Jan 2006
Added a button to the queue tab on the main form: "Add Shutdown". This adds a shutdown job to the end of the queue. Automatic shutdown can still be set using the checkbox in the Settings form.
Revised: Removed the use of system jobs and added shutdown checkboxes to the Oneclick window and queue tab.
Shutdown status is now displayed in the window title if it's enabled.
Modified main window title to revert to name+version after the job queue has finished.
Fixed tri-state GUI display dependencies in x264ConfigDialog.cs

0.2.3.1031a 5 Jan 2006
More fixes for Segoe font (Win Vista default)
Attempt to fix a tri-state bug introduced in 0.2.3.1031

0.2.3.1031 5 Jan 2005 (pulled from relese)
Redesigned x264 codec config and part of the main form (original patch by mutant_fruit)
Fixed crash on configuring level-incompatible x264 settings
Fixed the over-restrictive AVC Levels, and the ignored Validate AVC Level dialog results
Fixed the displacement of the SettingsForm.cs controls and allowed to select a any folder in Settings to located Avisynth filters.

Fixed PSNR checkbox label for Segoe font (Win Vista default) in x264ConfigurationDialog.cs

0.2.3.1030 2 Jan 2005
Redesigned One Click mode to have a basic and advanced tab. Added oneclick profiles, and added support for avs profiles inside oneclick.
Allowed user to select "Don't care" for the file target in both AutoEncode and OneClick, so that MeGUI will not adjust the bitrate to reach the target, but will instead use the profile's settings. This also allows the use of crf and qp in AutoEncode and OneClick.

0.2.3.1029a 1 Jan 2005
Added context sentisive help

0.2.3.1029 31 Dec 2005

Increased the cropping maximum to 200.

0.2.3.1024 23 Dec 2005
Altered the name formation for the filename used for the log when saving.
Tidied up the resolution calculations in the avisynth creator so that they behave consistently.
Added 1.78 to the list of accepted aspect ratios in getAspectRatio() (not sure why it wasn't there already...).
Altered the code executed on opening an avs file in the main form so that it will always change the output filename appropriately.
Sharktooth's changes: 
Integrated changes to use Nero7 audio encoder 
Weighted prediction and no-fast pskip removed from turbo first pass
Corrected bug that caused the mencoder call-back to hang
Fixes to GUI layout for Segoe font

0.2.3.1023 11 Dec 2005
Fixed a bug in generation of turbo 1st pass job in automated 2(or 3)-pass mode.

0.2.3.1022 10 Dec 2005
Altered the order in which codec settings are applied to the dialog on generation so that the dependencies
are calculated correctly.
Disabled quantiser groupbox in SVN builds (left it out of previous patch)

0.2.3.1021 9 Dec 2005
Added a size check to the video player resizing routine to prevent scaling out of the host form boundaries.
Consolidated and rationalised the tri-state dependencies in the x264 Config GUI.
Added Sharktooth's No Fast P-Skip option and removed AQ from x264 Config

0.2.3.1020 6 Dec 2005
Altered Path.GetDirectoryName to MeGUI.GetDirectoryName
Removed a redundant piece of debugging code from jobUtil.openvideo
Fixed a bug caused by incorporating the progress window code in the wrong place

0.2.3.1019 6 Dec 2005
Changes by doom9 to make show progress window context sensitive.
Added resizing to the video preview window.

0.2.3.1018 2 Dec 2005
Forced avs output to YV12
Restructured the code to open a video source in order to accomodate opening the dialog with a source already
specified.
Altered the formation of the main window's title. Version changes need only be set in AssemblyInfo.cs now.
Added berriman's avs script profile changes. (Move your avisynth plugins!) - Fixed it to load dgdecode from the
DGMPGDec directory

0.2.3.1017 2Dec 2005
Added AVI and vdr support. Will need to clean up any unneeded interface code later.
Added MPEG2 colour correction using Wilbert's ColorMatrix function.
Fixed 'suggest resolution' for cases in which no DAR is specified.

0.16 30 Nov 2005
Fixed the library calls so that users who have dgdecode.dll in the same dir as MeGUI won't experience a crash
(TBH I was being sloppy in not cleaning up the library code). Users should still be encouraged to remove 
dgdecode.dll from their MeGUI directory for future compatibility reasons.
Fixed the check for presence of the Progress window so that update events won't be sent to it if it's not there.

0.15 29 Nov 2005
Removed trellis in turbo mode (Sharktooth)
Fixed file filter for the dialog to open stats files (was reading them as .log, but was writing them as .stats)
Added more info to one of the level violation warnings
Fixed the automatic dgindexer dialog call so that it won't close the avisynth script window if the dialog is cancelled
Added extra case variants to the MPEG input filter in avisynth script creator

0.14 26 Nov 2005
Added further automation to the avisynth script creator to load needed plugins.
Discovered that I was using an out-of-date version of Decomb.dll. Modified the script creator to use the
latest version and to use LeakKernelDeInt.dll, as I see DG recommends that.

0.13 26 Nov 2005
Added code to the avisynth creator to automatically insert a LoadPlugin call to dgdecode.dll.
Tidied up the input-field enabler code in EnforeLevels() so that it correctly reflects possible states.

0.12 26 Nov 2005
Fixed a warning in d2vReader, though I may want to go back and do something more involved with the exception later.
Also added a bit more error-handling for the code to load dgdecode.dll.
Altered the "$& conditional compilation code so that it works with the new additions. 'compile all' should
produce no warnings or errors.

0.11 26 Nov 2005
Fixed a minor bug in the MPEG2 input filter for avisynth creator

0.10 26 Nov 2005
For some reason adding the path to dgdecode.dll in the PATH env var wasn't working for the imports done
in d2vReader.cs. After wasting far too much time trying various things I just did it a specific LoadLibrary()
call. Intialisation of the d2vReader now reads in the settings.xml file and finds the path to DGIndex from there.
Also added a call to this.saveSettings() when the Settings form closes.

0.9 26 Nov 2005
Added in the commandline generation patches to fix preview of automated 3-pass posted by doom9 (24Nov) and 
Sharktooth (25Nov).

0.8 25 Nov 2005
The 'SAR' calculated by the avisynth creator is now transferred directly to the configuration for x264, xvid and 
lavc encoders.
Audio language tag now defaults to English in the muxer.
Added a choice for minimal noise filtering to the avisynth creator: Undot().
Added a checkbox to the avisynth creator window to allow the choice of using dgdecode's integral deblocker.
Avisynth creator: Checking the 'Retain anamorphic resolution' box now causes 'Suggest resolution' to be
set to true automatically. 'On save close and load' is now checked by default as it was bugging me :). 
Fixed a couple of bugs in avisynth script generation so that the new options get written correctly.
 
0.7 24 Nov 2005
The path to DGIndex is now added to the PATH environment variable so that it's not necessary to put dgdecode.dll
in MeGUI's application dir.
Additions to the main settings dialog:
You can now specify the directory in which your avisynth plugins are stored. When loading a dll in the 
avisynthCreator Edit tab you'll automatically be sent to that directory.
There are 2 new text fields in the settings dialog for video and audio extensions. These will be
automatically added to the output name created when loading a video or audio file for encoding. This is optional
and defaults to null.

0.6 24 Nov 2005
Added the ability to load MPEG2 files directly in the AVisynth script creator. The vobinput dialog will be called
with appropriate settings installed. After the queued dgindexer job is run the avisynth window will re-open with the 
d2v file loaded.

0.5 24 Nov 2005
Altered the avi script creator to allow encoding of anamorphic input streams without losing vertical resolution.
A new checkbox is present in the svisynth window: "Retain anamorphic resolution and set SAR in encoder". If this
is checked the resolution controls operate as in GordianKnot when GK is set to an input PAR of 1:1. On saving the 
script a dialog will warn that SAR needs to be set in the encoder and gives the appropriate values. These values 
are also written in a comment at the end of the .avs that is saved. 
Added Telecide(order=1) option for PAL deinterlacing.

0.4 23 Nov 2005
Altered the way in which MeGUI handles changes to the video configuration in the x264 dialog. The aim is to 
allow n00bies like me to tinker with proper profiles such as the ones released by Sharktooth without overwriting 
them and forgetting what settings they've changed. 
There is a new option in the MeGUI Settings dialog: Safe Profile Alteration.
If this is checked, upon exiting the dialog by clicking OK after having changed any of the encoder settings 
APART from bitrate, SAR and zones, the program will create a new profile called "<old profile name>Tweaked" 
which contains the new settings. The user may subsequently revert back to the old profile at any time as it 
remains intact.
I excluded bitrate, SAR and zones from the protection as I thought those were elements that users might want 
to alter according to the particular video being encoded.

0.3 21 Nov 2005
Added a check for frame dimensions.
Moved a few utility calculations from JobUtils.cs to AVCLevels.cs and altered the parameters to validateAVCLevel()
in order to support the above.
Altered the return values from the look-up functions in AVCLevels.cs so that Unrestrained is treated the same
as level 5.1 for many checks - should alter this later.
Fixed a mistake in EnforceLevels()that could cause the number of reference frames to be set to 0.
Implemented a static flag in x264ConfigurationDialog.cs to reduce some of the event-handler recursion. Not sure
if this is necessary or even really desirable.
files changed:
Form1.cs
JobUtil.cs
x264ConfigurationDialog.cs
AVCLevels.cs

0.2 20 Nov 2005
Small fix to the enabling code for P4x4mv so it won't conflict with Macroblock Options.

Levels Patch 0.1 20 Nov 2005
All the relevant levels logic now sits in AVCLevels.cs and each decision is centralised to aid management.
Switching to a new profile is barred if the new profile violates the level that's selected. 
The selected level is enforced at each call to showCommandLine(). 
The enforcement code will attempt to make the current codec settings conform to the level specified. 
If it is unable to do so it will force the level to Unrestrained and the calling Form (x264ConfigurationDialog) 
will pop up a warning dialog.
